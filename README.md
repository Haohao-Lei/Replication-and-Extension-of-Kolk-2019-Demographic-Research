This repository contains the data and replication code for the article “Reassessing the U-Shaped Relationship Between Gender Equality and Fertility: A Replication and Extension of Kolk (2019) Using Comprehensive Gender Equality Measures”, published in Demographic Research. The project replicates and extends Kolk (2019) by incorporating the Historical Gender Equality Index (HGEI) and adjusting for tempo distortions in period total fertility rates.

All data used are publicly available, and details on data sources are provided in the paper and Appendix.

Below are the R scripts to produce all results in the manuscript and replicate Kolk’s (2019) original study.

- Coding.R: Contains a script to produce all results and graphs in the table, as well as a replication of Kolk’s (2019) original study.

- Country_Year_V-Dem_SPSS_v7.1: Data with the gender index from the VoD dataset used to replicate Kolk’s (2019) original study.

- fertility: Data file with period tfr and tempo-adjusted tfr across years from HFD.

- Gender equality: Data file that includes the Historical Gender Equality Index (HGEI) used in my analysis.

- Appendix: Contains data used to compare the country year between Kolk’s paper and my replication.

- Tables: Contains data used to compare the country year between Kolk’s original paper, my extension with HGEI, and my extension with tempo-adjusted TFR.
